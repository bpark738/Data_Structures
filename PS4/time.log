ESTIMATE of time to complete assignment: 25 hours

            Time                Time
     Date  Started  Spent Work completed
     ----  -------  ----  --------------
    10/13   8:00pm  2:00  Read assignment and relevant material in Aspnes's notes. Looked at stach.h and started
                          stack.c
    10/14   9:00pm  1:30  Continued to work on stack.c. Haivng some problems with pushing and popping tokens
    10/15	  4:30pm  0:40  Finished basic functionality of stack.c and tested the functions. May need to adjust
    					            what to do when stack is full for push and empty for pop. Will ask TA later for that.
    10/16   5:00pm  1:00  Started working on Calc.c. Learned about strtok function. Need to figure out how to
                          compare tokens with other strings to check if its an operator or parentheses.
    10/17   9:00pm  1:00  Fixed stack.c using stacktest.c from lecture.
    10/17  10:00pm  2:00  Worked to implement shunting yard algorithm to convert to post-fix.
    10/18   8:00pm  0:30  Fixed stack.c using valgrind on the zoo. Had some memory leaks. Seems 
                          to work fine with numbers using stacktest.c
    10/18   8:30pm  0:50  Worked on the shunting yard algorithm. Coded algorithm for the numbers
                          and operators. Still need to work to get the method to deal with 
                          parenthesis right.
    10/19   1:00pm  0:50  Edited my program to handle right parentheses in the shunting yard algorithm.
                          Program seems to work in converting pre-fix to post-fix. Fixed memory leaks as well
                          for parentheses.
    10/20  12:00pm  0:15  Implemented algorithm to evaluate post fix notation. Still need to work on the debug 
                          flag and check for bad inputs.
    10/21   3:00pm  1:15  Modified algorithm to handle the debug option of the problem. Had to rearrange code
                          to make this work. Still need to use strtod and print the stack debug message.
    10/21   4:15pm  0:30  Found no use for strtod. Got debug to work for the input half. Still need to 
                          print debug messages for the output.
    10/22   1:50pm  0:25  Got debug messages for the output to work. Still need to check for error in inputs.
    10/22   1:15pm  0:30  Added in defensive code for bad input like mismatched parentheses and two operators in
                          a row.
    10/22   2:15pm  1:15  Edited code to fix memory leak and checked for corner cases. program now passes all 
                          public tests but the last one.
    10/23   5:00pm  1:30  Edited code to print input in the right way. Test passes all public tests. Checked for
                          edge cases. Checked edge cases of too few operands and empty input. Will do more.
    10/26   7:00pm  1:30  Checked for edge cases. Fixed cases where multiple periods are used. Not fail
                          on input like 000 or 0.00. Had to change is_numeric() function. 
    10/27   7:00pm  1:00  Edited program for style.

                    My major difficulties in this homework was the debug flag which is not being tested and the 
                    different versions of Calcx that kept coming out. But for the actual programming of the
                    assignment, freeing memory was definitey a challenge. Especially since it is confusing
                    whether we have to free before exit(0) or not. Valgrind never gave any errors
                    when I didn't before. Also seg faulting continues to be a problem when I first
                    start the assignment. It is definitely something I need to keep conscious of. I thought 
                    knowing when to use pointers was hard for me in the beginning. I realized I didn't need
                    to use a pointer for the stack and could just use the object data type and its address for
                    use in functions.
