     Date  Started  Spent Work completed
     ----  -------  ----  --------------
    11/15  9:00pm	  1:30  Read assignment and read Van Wyk on heaps. Did most of heap.c coding.
    					            Not sure what to do for demand() but will ask TA. Need to test code too.
    11/16  7:00pm   1:00  Worked on heap.c as much as possible. Finished demand function after
    					            talking to TA. Fixed valgrind errors using heaptest.c. Will work on Fire.c.
    11/16  8:00pm   1:30  Worked on Fire.c. Set up the program with fgets and tokenizing the input.
    					            Learned the idea of depth first search and will try to implement it.
    11/16  9:30pm   2:00  Implemented depth first search. Need to check for memory leaks. Found a way
                          to see if neighbors are not in hash table.
    11/17  7:00pm   1:20  Fixed the one memory leak from day before. Implemented conn using depth first 
                          search. Implemented a function to check whether the graph is directed or
                          undirected. No memory leaks. Can't run public test for some reason. 
    11/17  8:20pm   1:40  Finished implementing heap.c with the internal grow and initialize functions.
    11/18  5:00pm   2:00  Fixed mindelete for heap.c and implemented breadth first search. Tested on one
                          of the public test cases and it seems to work. Need to work on best first search
                          next.
    11/19  5:10pm   0:30  Implemented best first search. It was easy to do with bfs already done.
                          Need to clean up code and do edge cases. Might work to get the meat on homework 7
                          done first though.
    11/24  6:00pm   3:10  Fixed memory leaks for bfs and best first search, took a very long time. 
                          Started to clean up the directed flag code. 
    11/24  6:10pm   0:30  Cleaned up directed flag and connected flag code and marking visited nodes as 
			                    unvisited after each method. Program passes all public tests.
    11/25  9:30pm   0:30  Edited program for style. Made minor edits to make program shorter.
                          Need to check for edge cases.
    11/26 10:45pm   0:30  Changed code to use one function to implement bfs and best to make code more concise.
                          Need to handle edge cases and will be done.
    11/28  7:40pm   1:00  Checked for some edge cases and edited program accordingly. Not sure if program
                          too long. Almost 400 lines of code.
    11/30  7:00pm   2:00  Checked edged cases and added in comments for style.

                    My major difficulties with this assignment were definitely memory leaks. I had a hard
                    time fixing memory leaks for the bfs and best fit methods, since there were a lot of
                    things to malloc and keep track of. I also had a hard time figuring out how to do
                    delete min and the order of freeing something and deleting something. Definitely had
                    some trouble on imlementing the heap methods as well. For dfs, I felt recursion 
                    wasn't as hard as before. Last thing is making the code succinct was pretty
                    hard for this assignment. My code is just under 400 lines which is way more than usual.
