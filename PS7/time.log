ESTIMATE of time to complete assignment: 25 hours

     Date  Started  Spent Work completed
     ----  -------  ----  --------------
    11/20  9:00pm	0:50  Read assignment, set up program, and implemented two word solution.
    11/22  1:45pm   2:10  Read up on dynamic programming and implemented DP and printed matrix. 
    11/23  4:40pm   0:50  Figured out how to print words from matrix. Tested some words against
    					  the staff solution. 
    11/25  10:00pm  0:20  Cleaned up code and commented for readability.
    11/26  10:00pm  0:20  Made minor edits to make program output match the spec.
                          Not sure what to do for default dictionary, if a dictionary is 
                          required in the command line argument.
    12/05  5:00pm   3:00  Fixed testing whether a word can be found using the matrix. Did this
                          by implementing a recursive function. Also fixed output to 
                          pass the public tests. My program passes all public tests now.
                          Also changed command line code so that an online dictionary
                          can be read.
    12/06  8:00pm   1:00  Checked for test cases. Fixed for empty word input. 
    12/07  2:00pm   0:30  Edited program for style.
    12/08  7:00pm   0:45  Checked for edge cases. Fixed for non-alpha characters stdin. Not sure 
                          what to do if it happens for online dictionary.
    12/08  7:55pm   0:45  Checked for more edge cases and fixed issues.

                  The challenges for this problem set were thinking about how to implement
                  the matrix like in the video and processing the matrix.
                  Unlike before, it wasn't mainly due to memory leaks and 
                  that sort of thing. Also had a timing issue, since I took a big 
                  break from when I initially worked on the pset and when I tried to
                  finish it. This was mostly due to other work
                  that had a higher priority at the time. Had to relearn the matrix and stuff.
                  In addition, thinking about test cases were pretty hard as well.
                  Dynamic programming concept was hard to get my head around of, but the
                  simpler examples like the Fibonacci sequence helpd.
